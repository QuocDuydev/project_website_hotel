            it’ll be easy for you to access your property and start enjoying your holiday!

            You can always contact your host with any questions leading up to your trip. Perhaps you want to let them know what time you’re
            arriving or you have a special request – enjoy stress-free communication at all times.

            Maybe you’ve always stayed in hotels and you’re not sure how to ‘check-in’ to an apartment or holiday home. Don’t worry, other guests have felt the same!
            That’s why hosts provide all the information you need to get you settled in.
